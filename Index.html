                This is a section in which this website would tell you 
                how to take better notes. This website though, does not 
                tell you how to take better notes, I lied. It just is a 
                layout for a website that could possibly tell you how to 
                take better notes, but doesn't actually give you any insight 
                on the topic. Sorry for the misinformation.
